#include <iostream> - iostream is a header file that contains functions for basic input and output 
operations.

int main() {
  We begin the program by invoking the main function.
  The program works step by step in the order we write.
  std::cout << "I like pizza" << std::endl; -> standard character out -> prints the output on the screen.
  std::cout << "I also like sandwich" << '\n';
  return 0; -> by returning 0 we can say that the function is successfully executed.
}

std::endl - ends the line until the text before it or you can use '\n'.
benefit of using endl is that endl flushes the output buffer.
